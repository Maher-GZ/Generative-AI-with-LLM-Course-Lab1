# Summarize Dialogue (Generative AI With Large Language Models)

This repository contains code for a course lab focused on summarizing dialogues using generative AI with Large Language Models (LLMs). The lab explores how input text affects model output and involves prompt engineering to direct the model towards the desired task.

## Overview

In this lab, we use the FLAN-T5 model from Hugging Face to generate summaries of dialogues. We employ the DialogSum dataset, which comprises 10,000+ dialogues with manually labeled summaries and topics.

## Requirements

- Hugging Face transformers package
- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maher-GZ/Summarize-Dialogue-Generative-AI-With-LLM-Lab1-.git
